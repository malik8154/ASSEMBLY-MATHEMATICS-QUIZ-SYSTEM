# 🧮 Assembly Mathematics Quiz System

An **interactive quiz game** developed in **Assembly Language (x86, 16-bit)**.  
This program asks the user **10 mathematics questions** and dynamically updates the score based on correct (+1) or incorrect (−1) answers.  
At the end of the game, the final score is displayed.
